 IVF increases the likelihood of multiple pregnancies, especially when multiple embryos are transferred. While the natural twin rate is around 1-2%, IVF treatments can raise the chance to 20-30% depending on age, embryo quality, and number transferred. Triplets or higher-order multiples are less common but possible. Multiple pregnancies carry risks such as preterm birth, low birth weight, and pregnancy complications. Therefore, clinics now recommend single embryo transfer (SET) for many patients to reduce these risks. Modern IVF practices aim for a healthy singleton pregnancy. Your fertility doctor will guide the decision based on your specific situation and medical history.
